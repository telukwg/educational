## Introduction
Godot is a very powerful game building system that is able to build games for different platforms, and different types of games.

This information was collected in May 2024, when version 4.x of Godot was current.

Types of games include:
- 2D
  - SideScroller/Platformer
  - Iso
- 3D

## Learning
Here are a bunch of websites offering information about learning Godot:

### Video Overviews
Mainly short videos to give you an overview of what Godot is capable of, and perhaps an idea of the level of difficulty

### Repositories
Much can be learned from looking at how other people built an application, and there are some Code Repositories which have many copies of applications which you can view

- https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset

### Forums
Forums are websites where you can interact with other users to learn more about Godot.  If you sign up an account to a forum, you may be able to ask questions to get help from other people.  Remember:
- ask your parents (you may need to be of a certain age before you are allowed to create an account)
- be polite to people on the forum

Some forums:
- https://forum.godotengine.org/
- https://godotforums.org/

Discord is another forum - you need an "invite" to get access to it - the main Godot website below contains a link to Discord that will automatically generate an invite for you:

### Advanced
Here are some advanced topics.

Source Code Versioning systems (aka "Source Code Management" / SCM) are complex tools that let you keep track of all the changes you have made to your software project.  They let you work with a team of people.  The do take a lot of learning to get used to - and discipline to use; they're probably more useful for high school kids due to the complexity.  Note that these types of tools work best with text based programming languages - so the will typically work fine with Godot (which is mostly text based), but probably not so well with current version of Scratch - which at 2024 - appears to use non-text data to store the programming code.
